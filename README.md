# ChessLink Project Website

This repository contains the source code for the ChessLink project's documentation website, built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Development

To run the website locally for development:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the correct parent directory before cloning
    # Example: cd path/to/your/projects
    git clone <repository-url> website
    cd website
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. The site will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build

To generate static content into the `build` directory:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run build
```
Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```
This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Deployment instructions will depend on your hosting provider. See the [Docusaurus Deployment Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment) for common deployment methods.
